    I. You are tasked with creating a Python program to manage a student gradebook. The program should allow users to perform the following actions: 	
Add a new student: Users should be able to add a new student to the gradebook by providing the student's name.
Add a grade: Users should be able to add a grade for a specific student. They will enter the student's name and the grade (a number between 0 and 100).
Calculate the average grade: Users should be able to calculate and display the average grade for a specific student.
List all students: Users should be able to see a list of all students in the gradebook along with their average grades.
Exit: Users should be able to exit the program.
Use a dictionary to store the gradebook, where the keys are student names, and the values are lists of grades for each student. Implement a menu-based interface to allow users to select the action they want to perform.
Develop a Python program to implement this student gradebook manager. 

Gradebook Menu:
